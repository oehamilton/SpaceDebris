# SpaceDebris
Satellite Image Classification for Space Debris Detection

Building a machine learning model to classify satellite images and detect space debris is a critical challenge in space exploration. The project uses Python, TensorFlow, and AWS to process and classify images, demonstrating your ability to develop and deploy AI-driven solutions. This project is relevant to space tech companies (e.g., SpaceX, Planet Labs) and can be adapted to energy (e.g., detecting defects in solar panels) or sciences (e.g., environmental monitoring).

The SpaceDebris project requires the following packages:

tensorflow==2.15.0
pandas==2.2.2
opencv-python==4.10.0
matplotlib==3.9.2
flask==3.0.3
boto3==1.35.24
